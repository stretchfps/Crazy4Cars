# NextJS_Projects

Hello, my name is Shubham Mehra. I have built this device responsive SPA for a car rental website "Crazy4Cars" which displays the information necessary for a customer to know before renting out a car for themselves. For instance the car maker, model, pictures, fuel type, mileage, and so on. 

I have added the most relevant information needed for the customers to know about the cars. We have included multiple renowned manufacturers and famous models they are known for along with the images using API.

I have used HTML, CSS(Tailwind), JavaScript, NextJS, and API for building this project. Thanks to JavaScript Mastery for providing this so an aspiring Front-End developer could learn and become good.

Here are some screenshots of the website UI/UX as I could not host it. 

Here you can see the Header and the Hero components of the website with the tagline and "Book now" button.

Now we can check the section where the listing of the cars is which contains two search bars, two filters, and a search icon as well. Here we can search for a maker or model or both, and filter out on the bases of the type of fuel and the year of the model.

Here we see when the user hovers over the card, the information on the card will be replaced by the "View more" button which makes the user click and see the complete information of that car.

After they click, there will be a pop-up card with a few milliseconds of delayed animation to show a cool effect as well as a very light shadow for the hovering effect. This card not only shows the user the necessary information which helps the user to make a decision in selecting a car but also shows them four different images from different angles.

Last but not least we have added a "Show More" button in order to have the pagination of the car listings. And below that is the Footer section with the necessary contact information and links to socials.
